# CandlestickChartPython
Using Yahoo Finance and IEX Cloud, I created a program which outputs candlestick charts for given tickers. The program creates .html files which hold the charts. I used the LMT (Lockheed Martin Cooperation) and RTX (Raytheon Technologies) tickers for this program. In the chart, I noted several events that may have influenced market behavior. 

This project borrows partly from Part Time Larry's Tutorial on Building Candle Stick Charts with Python. However, I have altered the companies analyzed, the information displayed, the style of display, and I created a function which would be able to take in any desired  .csv file to convert to a chart.
