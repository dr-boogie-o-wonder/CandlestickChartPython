# CandlestickChartPython
Using Yahoo Finance and IEX Cloud, I created a program which outputs candlestick charts for given tickers. I used the LMT and RXT tickers for this program. 
In the chart, I noted several events that may have influenced bearish or bullish behavior. This project borrows partly from Part Time Larry's Tutorial on 
Building Candle Stick Charts with Python.

I have altered the companies analyzed, the information displayed, the style of display, and I created a function which would be able to take in any desired 
.csv file to convert to a chart. 

I looked at Raytheon Technologies and Lockheed Martin Coorperation in this project and marked events which could have influenced market behaviors
