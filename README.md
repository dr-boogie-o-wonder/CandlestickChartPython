# CandlestickChartPython
Using Yahoo Finance and IEX Cloud, I created a program which outputs candlestick charts for given tickers. The program creates .html files which hold the charts. I used the LMT (Lockheed Martin Cooperation) and RTX (Raytheon Technologies) tickers for this program. In the chart, I noted several events that may have influenced market behavior. I have alsocreated a function which would be able to take in any desired  .csv file to convert to a chart.
